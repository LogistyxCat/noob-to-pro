First we run the given file and we see that it is asking to enter a password.
After entering password it check that password and tell us whether it is right or wrong.
That means there must be comparision in the assembly code.
using gdb we found that there is a line:

0x0804842b <+71>:	cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4],0x149a
0x08048432 <+78>:	je     0x8048442 <main+94>

first line compare the entered password with 5274 and second line , if password matches with 5274 it jumpes to address: 0x8048442
 which print password is correct.

So 5274 is the correct password.
